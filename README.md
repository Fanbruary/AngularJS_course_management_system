# Course Assignment App board 

## Project summary 
A course and assignment management system designed for lecturer and student, where they can manage their courses and manipulate course-related assignments. 
<br/>

The design idea of this system comes from 'Canvas' which in my opinion is much more user-friendly than the system 'Blackboard' which is still in use at VUW.
Also, The project was fished under a group of two. Thank you Leah for your insightful design ideas and corporation.
